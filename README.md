## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

- I started with the HTML, I usually start with the Design, but since this challenge from Frontend Mentor already has the design done, I started with the HTML structure.
Shortly after, I went for a basic styling with Sass/CSS. Then I went to the tool's functionality with JavaScript.
I made the function that calculated the age, then inserted it into the form with a Click event.
After everything was working, I also added a number animation.
